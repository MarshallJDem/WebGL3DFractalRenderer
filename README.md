# WebGL3DFractalRenderer
This is a WebGL2 3D Fractal Real Time Renderer.

It is a free open source project that utilizes WebGL2 to render 3D fractals in real time, with the ability to edit any constants or iteration counts on the fly as it renders. There are several prebuilt fractal fold equations and geometric objects that you can use in combination with custom constants to make your own fractals and play with the constants in real time.
